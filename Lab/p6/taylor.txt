i walked through the door with you
the air was cold
but something about it felt like home somehow
and i left my scarf there at your sisters house
and youve still got it in your drawer even now
oh your sweet disposition
and my wideeyed gaze
were singing in the car getting lost upstate
autumn leaves falling down like pieces into place
and i can picture it after all these days
and i know its long gone and that magics not here no more
and i might be okay but im not fine at all
cause there we are again on that little town street
you almost ran the red cause you were lookin over at me
wind in my hair i was there
i remember it all too well
photo album on the counter
your cheeks were turning red
you used to be a little kid with glasses in a twinsized bed
and your mothers telling stories bout you on the teeball team
you told me bout your past thinking your future was me
and i know its long gone and there was nothing else i could do
and i forget about you long enough to forget why i needed to
cause there we are again in the middle of the night
were dancing round the kitchen in the refrigerator light
down the stairs i was there
i remember it all too well yeah
and maybe we got lost in translation
maybe i asked for too much
but maybe this thing was a masterpiece til you tore it all up
running scared i was there
i remember it all too well
and you call me up again just to break me like a promise
so casually cruel in the name of being honest
im a crumpled up piece of paper lying here
cause i remember it all all all
too well
time wont fly its like im paralyzed by it
id like to be my old self again
but im still trying to find it
after plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own
now you mail back my things and i walk home alone
but you keep my old scarf from that very first week
cause it reminds you of innocence
and it smells like me
you cant get rid of it
cause you remember it all too well yeah
cause there we are again when i loved you so
back before you lost the one real thing youve ever known
it was rare i was there i remember it all too well
wind in my hair you were there you remember it all
down the stairs you were there you remember it all
it was rare i was there i remember it all too well
you are somebody that i dont know
but youre taking shots at me like its patr√≥n
and im just like damn its 700 am
say it in the street thats a knockout
but you say it in a tweet thats a copout
and im just like hey are you okay
and i aint trying to mess with your selfexpression
but ive learned the lesson that stressin
and obsessin bout somebody else is no fun
and snakes and stones never broke my bones so
so ohoh ohoh ohoh ohoh ohoh
you need to calm down
youre being too loud
and im just like ohoh ohoh ohoh ohoh ohoh oh

you need to calm down
you are somebody that we dont know
but youre coming at my friends like a missile
why are you mad
when you could be glaad you could be glaad
sunshine on the street at the parade
but you would rather be in the dark ages
making that sign mustve taken all night
you just need to take several seats and then try to restore the peace
and control your urges to scream about all the people you hate
cause shade never made anybody less gay so
so ohoh ohoh ohoh ohoh ohoh
you need to calm down
youre being too loud
and im just like ohoh ohoh ohoh ohoh ohoh oh

loving him is like driving a new maserati down a deadend street
faster than the wind passionate as sin ending so suddenly
loving him is like trying to change your mind
once youre already flying through the free fall
like the colors in autumn so bright just before they lose it all
losing him was blue like id never known
missing him was dark gray all alone
forgetting him was like tryin know somebody you never met
but loving him was red
loving him was red
touching him was like realizing all you ever wanted
was right there in front of you
memorizing him was as easy as knowing all the words
to your old favorite song
fighting with him was like trying to solve a crossword
and realizing theres no right answer
regretting him was like wishing you never found out
that love could be that strong
losing him was blue like id never known
missing him was dark gray all alone
forgetting him was like tryin know somebody you never met
but loving him was red
oh red
burning red
remembering him comes in flashbacks and echoes
tell myself its time now gotta let go
but moving on from him is impossible
when i still see it all in my head
in burning red
loving him was red
oh losing him was blue like id never known
missing him was dark gray all alone
forgetting him was like tryin to know
somebody you never met
cause loving him was red
yeah yeah red
were burning red
and thats why hes spinning round in my head
comes back to me burning red
yeah yeah
his love was like driving a new maserati down a deadend street
